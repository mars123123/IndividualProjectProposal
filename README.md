# Wellness App

## Project Abstract:
Create an android phone app that helps to monitor your health. This app tracks your daily sleep count, work out frequency, weight, and work/school hours. You can set goals that you want to accomplish (ex: work out 3x a week) and track them week by week. Additionally it will keep information in regards to social media usage/phone usage to make sure you aren’t wasting time on that. Each week and month the user will get a rating based on how well they did in achieving their goals. A high rating will be scored weekly when the user meets their goals, has a low social media usage, sleeps a healthy amount.. etc. Futhermore, we can creat a desktop application that also monitors social media/game usage in order to report on this as well. Another module that can be added to this project is a friends/family list where you can share your results. If a friendlist is added we can make a local leaderboard to compare the list of users results.

## Project Relevance:
This project can be developed using the educational goals because it will be developed in Java for Android, so we can use JUnit test driven development to create the product and test each module individually. Using Java we can develop using object oriented programming, for example object oriented screens and views. The design of the goals could be created using a goals interface, with a series of goals that implement from it. We can create UML to design the app, and show the relationship between different views and fragments, goals, and DB. The user will also interact with the app using a GUI, and we can store the user’s data in a DB.

## Requried Resources:
- Android Studio
- Optional: Windows phone
